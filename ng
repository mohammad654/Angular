Component Interaction:
Angular applications are typically organized into components, which can communicate with each other through various methods. This interaction can include passing data between parent and child components using input properties (@Input) and emitting events from child to parent components using output properties (@Output). This is a fundamental concept in Angular development.

Service Communication:
Angular services provide a way to share data and functionality across different parts of an application. Services can be used to centralize data management and communication between components, facilitating a linear flow of data and logic throughout the application.

Routing and Navigation:
Angular's routing module allows you to set up navigation between different views (components) in a linear manner. You can define routes, configure navigation paths, and create links to navigate through your application's different sections.

Data Binding:
Data binding in Angular allows you to establish a connection between the UI and application logic. It ensures that changes in the application state are reflected in the UI and vice versa, creating a linear relationship between data and its representation.

Observables and RxJS:
Angular commonly uses RxJS observables to handle asynchronous operations. Observables provide a way to work with asynchronous data streams in a linear and manageable manner.
